                    <p class="place__brif">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of
                        the
                        Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up
                        here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the
                        winters
                        are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>

                    <p class="place__brif">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
                        all of it sprinkled
                        with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult
                        to
                        traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
                        interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right
                        one.

                        that
                        juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th
                        century.
                        Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a
                        popular
                        tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                    <p class="place__brif">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best
                        ice
                        cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                        claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for
                        its
                        spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only
                        Welshman
                        ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                    <p class="place__brif">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is
                        surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of
                        the
                        state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry,
                        candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival
                        celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>

                    <p class="place__brif"> However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
                        founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the
                        first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a
                        full-tuition scholarship. </p>

                        was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added
                        to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the
                        country's political and economic capitals</p>
                    <p class="place__brif">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think
                        you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest
                        places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea
                        and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
                    <p class="place__brif">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes,
                        overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the
                        beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude.
                        It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which
                        provide water around the country.</p>

                        who freed Judea from the rule of the Selucid Empire and established the Hasmonean dynasty,
                        events commemorated by the holiday of Hanukkah. The modern city was built in the 20th century.
